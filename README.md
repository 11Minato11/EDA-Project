# Concert Tour Analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis

This project performs a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on global concert tour data. It focuses on cleaning "dirty" datasets, engineering features, and performing statistical hypothesis testing to understand industry trends.

## Key Features
- **Data Sanitization**: Cleaning financial metrics using Regex.
- **Missing Value Imputation**: Artist-specific median filling.
- **Statistical Testing**: Pearson Correlation (Volume vs Revenue) and T-Tests (Era comparison).
- **Visualization**: Detailed plots for revenue distribution, efficiency, and tour durations.

## Project Structure
- `data.py`: Main processing and analysis script.
- `convert_to_pdf.py`: Script to generate the final report.
- `Report_Concert_Tour_Analysis.pdf`: The final analytical report.
- `plots/`: Visualizations generated during analysis.

## Analysis Results
Detailed findings are available in the **Report_Concert_Tour_Analysis.pdf** file.
